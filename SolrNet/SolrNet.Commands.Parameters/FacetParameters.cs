	/// Set to true, this parameter indicates that constraints should be sorted by their count.

	/// <summary>
	/// This param indicates the minimum document frequency (number of documents matching a term) for which the filterCache should be used when determining the constraint count for that term. 
	/// This is only used during the term enumeration method of faceting (field type faceting on multi-valued or full-text fields).
	/// A value greater than zero will decrease memory usage of the filterCache, but increase the query time. 
	/// When faceting on a field with a very large number of terms, and you wish to decrease memory usage, try a low value of 25 to 50 first.
	/// The default value is 0, causing the filterCache to be used for all terms in the field.

	/// <summary>
	/// This parameter will cause loading the underlying fields used in faceting to be executed in parallel with the maximum number of threads specified.
	/// By default (or with value=0) it will not spawn any threads. 
	/// Specifying a negative number of threads will spin up to Integer.MAX_VALUE threads.
	/// Currently this is limited to the fields, range and query facets are not yet supported.
	/// Requires Solr 4.5+
